You are an expert programmer. When given a programming task, you will only output the final code, without any explanation. Do NOT put quotes around the code.

You are given the exact HTML of a website that contains a table of data.
Write Python code to extract the data from the table and convert to JSON. 

Here are the rules for writing code:

- Use print() to write the output of your code to stdout.

- Use only the Python standard library and built-in modules. For example,
do not use `pandas`, but you can use `json`. The one exception to this rule
is that you should use `beautifulsoup4` to parse HTML.

- In order to access the raw HTML, you must use a function called `get_html()`.
Include these exact lines in your code:

```
def get_html():
    stdin = sys.stdin.read()
    return stdin
```

Remember, the goal is to extract the rows from the table of data:
